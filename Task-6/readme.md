# üìö Task 4: Working with Collections and LINQ in C#

## üìå Objective
The objective of this task is to build a **Student Management Console Application** using C#. This application demonstrates the use of:

- **Collections** (`List<Student>`) to store and manage student data.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** for filtering and sorting data.
- **Console-based interaction** for user input and dynamic filtering.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Create a `Student` class with properties: `Name`, `Age`, and `Grade`.
- Collect and store multiple student records using `List<Student>`.
- Allow filtering students based on:
  - A user-defined **age threshold**
  - A user-defined **grade threshold**
- Sort the filtered students by:
  - **Grade (descending)**
  - **Name (ascending)**
- Display the final list to the user.
- Continue filtering until the user exits.

---

## üîç How the Program Works

### 1. **Defining the Student Class**

A simple `Student` class holds:
- `name`: Student's name
- `age`: Student's age
- `grade`: Student's grade (as an integer)

---

### 2. **Collecting Student Data**

- The user is prompted to enter how many students they want to add.
- For each student, the user provides:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Grade
- Each student is stored as a `Student` object and added to the `students` list.

---

### 3. **Filtering and Sorting**

The program allows the user to choose how to filter students:

- **By Age**: Uses a LINQ *query expression* to:
  - Filter students whose age is greater than or equal to the threshold.
  - Sort them by grade (descending), then by name (ascending).

- **By Grade**: Uses a LINQ *method syntax* to:
  - Filter students whose grade is greater than the threshold.
  - Sort them by grade (descending), then by name (ascending).

---

### 4. **Loop and Exit**

- The application continuously prompts the user to filter by `age`, `grade`, or `exit`.
- Typing `exit` gracefully terminates the application.
